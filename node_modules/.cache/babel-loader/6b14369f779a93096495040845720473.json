That would change when he would hear\n            his cousin play <a className=\"text_link\" href={condor} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n            \"O Último Condor\" by Almir Sater</a> on it. Since then, he started to compose music in Portuguese,\n            influenced by Brazilian singer-songwriters like Almir Sater and Zé Ramalho.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Around that time, a friend was putting together a magician act and needed original music. He wrote and performed a set of\n            original songs in Portuguese for the act \"O Fantástico Circo de Aracnídea\", which was a flop.\n            In one of the rehearsals, though, one magician explained to him the chemistry behind a certain magic trick, which ignited\n            his curiosity for the subject.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Putting music aside for a while, he earned a Master's Degree in computational chemistry from Universidade de Franca, and\n            published his scientific contributions in <a className=\"text_link\" href={chemistry}\n            target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Journal of Luminescence\"</a>, <a className=\"text_link\" href={chemicalphysics}\n            target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Chemical Physics\"</a>, <a className=\"text_link\" href={chemistryc}\n            target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Journal of Physical Chemistry C\"</a> and <a className=\"text_link\" href={natural}\n            target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Natural Products Communications\"</a>. After teaching chemistry for one year,\n            he moved to Finland to pursue a Ph.D..\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            After 2 years living in Finland, he met the Finnish producer Joel Lindfors, who produced and released his compositions\n             \"Lago Brasil\" and \"Nós dois merecemos viver\".\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            2020 was a hard year for the composer, due to the loss of a dear one. While visiting Brazil, he took confort in the work of <a className=\"text_link\" href={ariano}\n            target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Ariano Suassuna\"</a>, which inspired him to produce songs from\n            the \"O Fantástico Circo de Aracnídea\" infamous show, using only Brazilian instruments at OctoSonus Studios-São Paulo. The songs were \"Abrahadabra\", \"Flores pelo céu\" and\n            \"Feiticeiro Esteve Aqui\".\n            </p>\n              <p>\n            By returning to Finland, he joined a Latin band where he met Rolando, Satu and Seppo. Months later,\n            \"Pedro Bergamo & Los Santeros\" was born. The result is a mixture of sertanejo, Finnish folk and progressive\n            rock.\n            </p>\n\n        </Col>\n\n      </Row>\n    </Container>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default Bio;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
